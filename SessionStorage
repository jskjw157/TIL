Session storage and local storage are both types of web storage that allow you to store data on a user's browser, 
but they have some differences:

1. Duration of storage: Local storage stores data permanently, even after the user closes their browser or navigates away from your website. 
Session storage, on the other hand, only stores data while the user has an active session with your website, 
and the data is cleared when the user closes their browser or navigates away from your website.

2. Size of storage: Local storage has a larger size limit than session storage, which allows you to store more data.

3. Data sharing: Local storage data is accessible to all windows or tabs from the same origin (i.e., website), 
while session storage data is limited to the current window or tab.

4. Implementation: Both session storage and local storage are implemented using JavaScript APIs and store data in key-value pairs.

In conclusion, local storage is better suited for storing data that needs to persist across multiple sessions, 
while session storage is better suited for temporarily storing data that needs to persist during a user's session.
